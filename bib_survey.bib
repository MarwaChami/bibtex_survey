abstract = {Summary Software defined networking emerges as a promising paradigm shift that decouples the control plane from the data plane. It has the ability to centrally monitor and control the network through softwarization, ie, controller. Deploying a single controller is inefficient to handle large network traffic; thereby, making multiple controllers are a necessity of current software defined networking in wide area networks. Placing multiple controllers in an optimum way, ie, controller placement is a vibrant research problem. Controller placement problem (CPP) is of twofold: the minimum number of controllers to be placed in a network and locations of these controllers. Numerous researchers in the last 5 years (2012 to November 2017) have proposed solutions for the CPP, which is an NP-hard problem. In general, solutions are based on objective functions and their optimum solutions considering various factors (such as propagation latency between switches and controllers, and intercontrollers) and constraints (such as the capacity of controllers and switches). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt of state-of-the-art review on CPP. This paper classifies the CPP, critically analyzes the existing solutions, and finds limitations and future scope existing, which will help potential researchers in this area to innovate new solutions for CPP lying on this information.}

abstract = "In Internet-oriented Software Defined Network (SDN), the feasibility and scalability are guaranteed by the cooperation among multiple controllers, thus the effective placement of these controllers becomes the significant task. In this paper, we formulate a Multi-objective Optimization Controller Placement (MOCP) problem, which focuses on achieving high network reliability, load balance among controllers, and low latency among controllers and switches. The MOCP covers three specific questions: where the controllers should be placed, how to assign controllers to switches, and how many routing requests should be processed by each controller. We use Adaptive Bacterial Foraging Optimization (ABFO) algorithm and redefine its computation rules to solve the MOCP problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ABFO based MOCP scheme is effective and has better performance than the existing ones."

abstract = "Controller Placement Problem (CPP) is an important task in Software Defined Networks (SDNs). Meanwhile, the assignment of switches to the controllers plays a key role in the Quality of Service (QoS). Most of previous works assumed that each switch is assigned to the nearest controller based on propagation latency. In this paper, propagation delay, hop count and link utilization are considered for such assignment. First, the influence of these metrics on the QoS is analyzed. Then, using these criteria, a new Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique is presented to perform the multi criteria assignment process. Several evaluations are conducted to analyze this approach and justify the importance of trade-off among all the assignment criteria. Furthermore, an algorithm called Controller Placement Genetic Algorithm (CPGA) that is hybridized by the proposed AHP technique is introduced to solve this special kind of CPP. Results show the efficiency of our new assignment approach regarding link load balancing problem."

abstract = {Summary Software‐defined networking (SDN) has been widely researched and used to manage large‐scale networks such as data center networks (DCNs). An early stage of SDN controller experienced low responsiveness, low scalability, and low reliability. To solve these problems, distributed SDN controllers have been proposed. The concept of distributed SDN controllers distributes control messages among multiple SDN controllers. However, distributed SDN controllers must assign a master controller for each networking devices. Most previous studies, however, did not consider the characteristics of DCNs. Thus, they are not suitable to operate in DCNs. In this paper, we propose HeS‐CoP, a heuristic switch‐controller placement scheme for distributed SDN controllers in DCNs. With the control traffic load and CPU load, HeS‐CoP decides when our scheme should be performed in DCNs. To show the feasibility of HeS‐CoP, we designed and implemented an orchestrator that contains our proposed scheme and then evaluated our proposed scheme. As a result, our proposed scheme well distributes the control traffic load, decreases the average CPU load, and reduces the packet delay.}

abstract = {Summary Software‐defined network (SDN) is an emerging network paradigm that allows flexible network management by providing programmability from a separated control plane. Because of the centralized management scheme that SDN adopts, intensive control plane overhead incurs as the scale of SDN increases. The control plane overhead is mainly caused by a massive amount of control messages generated during data plane monitoring and reactive flow instantiation. By far, very few works have addressed the overhead issue on reaction flow instantiation; therefore, we mainly focus on alleviating such overhead in this work. To achieve this goal, we propose a new control plane management (CPMan) method. CPMan aims to realize the following two objectives: first, reduce the number of control messages exchanged through the control channel and second, evenly distribute the control workload across multiple controllers to mitigate the potential performance bottleneck. To realize the former, we propose a lightweight feedback loop‐based control scheme, whereas for the latter, we propose a dynamic switch‐to‐controller (DSC) placement scheme. To show the feasibility of our proposal, we implemented a prototype of the two proposed schemes on top of a carrier‐grade SDN controller and validated its performance in an emulated network. We achieved approximately 57.13\% overhead reduction with feedback loop‐based control scheme, while achieved approximately 98.68\% balance ratio with DSC placement scheme.

abstract = {Summary By separating control plane from data plane, software‐defined network (SDN) adopts centralized controllers to manage data flows in the network. Nevertheless, the rapid growth of network service traffic requires a large number of controllers, reducing network performance due to the scalability constraint. Therefore, we consider distributed placement of controllers in wide‐area network to construct a scalable SDN architecture, by taking service traffics, traffic propagation delay, and load balancing into account. Specifically, we first partition the network into several small sections (named SDN domains) and then place the least amount of controllers to a proper node in each domain. The architecture provides a control channel to deliver requested messages for each SDN domain, so it reduces the link delay (which is assumed to be proportional to the physical length of the link) between switches and SDN controllers. Unfortunately, it also introduces extra latency among controller sets at different SDN domain. Accordingly, we formulate an integer linear program to optimize network cost and performance by considering all those conflicting factors and propose an efficient heuristic algorithm called distributed SDN placement to solve the problem. Simulation results confirm that our proposed heuristic distributed SDN placement can achieve suboptimal solutions as compared with the integer linear program results.}

abstract="Software-defined networking (SDN) enables the network virtualization through SDN hypervisors to share the underlying physical SDN network among multiple logically isolated virtual SDN networks (vSDNs), each with its own controller. The vSDN embedding, which refers to mapping a number of vSDNs to the same substrate SDN network, is a key problem in the SDN virtualization environment. However, due to the distinctions of the SDN, such as the logically centralized controller and different virtualization technologies, most of the existing embedding algorithms cannot be applied directly to SDN virtualization. In this paper, we consider controller placement and virtual network embedding as a joint vSDN embedding problem, and formulate it into an integer linear programming with objectives of minimizing the embedding cost and the controller-to-switch delay for each vSDN. Moreover, we propose a novel online vSDN embedding algorithm called CO-vSDNE, which consists of a node mapping stage and a link mapping stage. In the node mapping stage, CO-vSDNE maps the controller and the virtual nodes to the substrate nodes on the basis of the controller-to-switch delay and takes into account the subsequent link mapping at the same time. In the link mapping stage, CO-vSDNE adopts the k-shortest path algorithm to map the virtual links. The evaluation results with simulation and Mininet emulation show that the proposed CO-vSDNE not only significantly increases the long-term revenue to the cost ratio and acceptance ratio while guaranteeing low average and maximum controller-to-switch delay, but also achieves good vSDN performance in terms of end-to-end delay and throughput.",
